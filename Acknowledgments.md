Thanks to the knowledgeable community at [r/aws](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws) for always providing great insights and opinions.

Thank you to our production editor, Christopher Faucher, for getting the book in tip-top shape for release. Thanks also to our editor, Virginia Wilson, for taking the time to work with first-time authors during a pandemic. Your patience, suggestions, and guidance allowed us to complete this book and remain (somewhat) sane :-)
