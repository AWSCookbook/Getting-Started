# Foreword

As part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) team since the beginning, I have been able to watch it grow in scale, richness, and complexity from a unique vantage point. Even after writing thousands of blog posts and millions of words, I learn something new and useful about AWS just about every day.

With well over two hundred services in production and more launching regularly, AWS could easily leave you feeling overwhelmed. In addition to tens of thousands of pages of official AWS documentation, bloggers, AWS Heroes, AWS Partners, and others have created innumerable pieces of content—including blog posts, videos, webinars, overviews, and code samples.

While there’s no substitute for having a full and complete understanding of a particular AWS service, the reality is that you often simply need to solve a “point” problem. Even after you understand a service, remembering how to use it to solve that problem can be a challenge—at least it is for me.

And that is where this cookbook comes in. Because of its broad selection of topics and carefully chosen recipes, I am confident that you will be able to quickly find one that addresses your immediate need and to put it into practice in short order. You can solve your problem, refresh your knowledge of that aspect of AWS, and move forward to create value for your customers!

My favorite aspect of this book is that it does not hand-wave past any of the details. Each recipe assumes that you start fresh and then helps you to cook up a perfectly seasoned solution. Nothing is left to chance, and you can use the recipes as is in most cases. The recipes also cover the all-important cleanup phase and ensure that you leave your AWS environment as you found it.

Where appropriate, the recipes use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and include all of the necessary “moving parts.” The CDK provides a double benefit; in addition to helping you to move forward more quickly, these CDK elements can help you learn more about how to put infrastructure as code (IaC) into practice.

Most cookbooks are designed to be browsed and savored, and this one is no exception. Flip through it, read an entire chapter, or use just a recipe or two, as you wish. I also recommend that you go through all of [Chapter 1](https://github.com/AWSCookbook/Security), just to make sure that your environment is set up and ready to go. Then, when you are presented with a problem to solve, find the appropriate recipe, put it into practice, and reap the benefits.
